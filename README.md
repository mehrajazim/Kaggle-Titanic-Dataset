# Kaggle-Titanic-Dataset
The k-nearest neighbors (KNN) algorithm is a non-parametric, supervised learning classifier, which uses proximity to make classifications or predictions about the grouping of an individual data point. 
This repo has code of prediction model on titanic survivor dataset with KNN
I have used this model to train on titanic survivor dataset to find how how well ths model works.
